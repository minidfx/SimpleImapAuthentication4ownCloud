# SimpleImapAuthentication4ownCloud

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/minidfx/SimpleImapAuthentication4ownCloud.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/minidfx/SimpleImapAuthentication4ownCloud)

Provide a simple authentication through IMAP for ownCloud, very useful for domain hosted because you won't have different credentials for users that have an email and an account in ownCloud.

Currently available only as **Alpha** version. I have to implement a way for checking whether the password from the IMAP server has changed, because currently you can access to ownCloud with an old password.
