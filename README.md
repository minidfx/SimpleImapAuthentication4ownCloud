# SimpleImapAuthentication4ownCloud

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/minidfx/SimpleImapAuthentication4ownCloud.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/minidfx/SimpleImapAuthentication4ownCloud)

Provide a simple authentication through imap for ownCloud.

Currently available only as **Alpha** version. I have to implement a way for checking whether the password from the IMAP server has changed, because currently you can access to ownCloud with an old password.
